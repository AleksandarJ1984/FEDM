abstract  = {This paper introduces the finite element discharge modelling (FEDM) code,
            which was developed using the open-source computing platform FEniCS
            (https://fenicsproject.org). Building on FEniCS, the FEDM code utilises the
            finite element method to solve partial differential equations. It extends
            FEniCS with features that allow the automated implementation and numerical
            solution of fully coupled fluid-Poisson models including an arbitrary
            number of particle balance equations. The code is verified using the method
            of exact solutions and benchmarking. The physically based examples of a
            time-of-flight experiment, a positive streamer discharge in
            atmospheric-pressure air and a low-pressure glow discharge in argon are
            used as rigorous test cases for the developed modelling code and to
            illustrate its capabilities. The performance of the code is compared to the
            commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics® and a comparable parallel
            speed-up is obtained. It is shown that the iterative solver implemented by
            FEDM performs particularly well on high-performance compute clusters.},
