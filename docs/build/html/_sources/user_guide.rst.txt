User Guide
==========
FEDM consists of three modules

- ``functions.py`` storing the functions used for problem definition,

- ``file_io.py`` for input and output of the data and

- ``physical_constants.py`` for storing the physical constants

These modules are used in the main script to set up the model and solve the equations, as illustrated in the examples.

In order to run the FEDM code, FEniCS version 2019.1.0. is required. The easiest way to obtain the desired version of FEniCS is using a Docker image.
Note that the FEniCS is depricated and thath the new version FEniCSx 0.7 has been recently introduced.
FEDM is primarily developed to be used with FEniCS (although some functions might be used with other python programmes) and there are no plans of
updating it to be compatible with the newest version (at least until the stable FEniCSx version is published).
